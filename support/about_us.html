	<h1>Who Are We?</h1>
	<p class="contact">Glycan Therapeutics possesses a unique patented technology to synthesize heparin and heparan sulfate 
	oligosaccharides for medical uses. Glycan Therapeutics (GT) is developing new drug therapies based on 
	a novel synthetic carbohydrate technology platform. The platform technology can be used to synthesize 
	an anticoagulant drug, like synthetic heparin, as well as design heparin-like oligosaccharides for research 
	and development for other medical applications.  We are the leader in the development of 
	enzymatically synthesized sulfated oligosaccharides for a variety of indications.  While aiming to develop 
	a cost-effective method to prepare synthetic heparin, the company is also preparing a wide ranges of 
	homogeneous heparin oligosaccharide products for researchers to investigate the role of these products 
	in vascular biology, developmental biology and infectious diseases.  The company has been supported 
	by SBIR contracts from National Cancer Institute.</p>

	<h1>Vision</h1>
	<p class="contact">Glycobiology is a fast-growing discipline to study the biological functions of carbohydrates.  In addition 
	to serving as an energy source, carbohydrate participate in bacteria and virus infections, stem cell 
	differentiation, and numerous vascular functions.  Carbohydrates are potentially a new class of 
	therapeutics with a promising future for treating human diseases. Glycan Therapeutics' vision is to 
	advance carbohydrate-based medicines through cutting edge research. The company owns an 
	innovative technology to synthesize heparin-like carbohydrates for drug discovery and research and 
	development.</p>
